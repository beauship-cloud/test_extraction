Cognitive Aids NMA — Data Extraction Tool (v5.3)
Streamlit app matching extraction form.
Deploy: GitHub → Streamlit Community Cloud.

Requires:
  - st.secrets["gcp_service_account"] : service-account JSON
  - Google Sheet with header row matching SHEET_HEADERS below

v5.3 changes (from v5.2) — protocol↔form reconciliation before extraction start:
  - SIMULATED PATIENT OUTCOME (new Outcome 5). The protocol lists simulated
    patient-related outcomes as a secondary outcome, "descriptive only, not pooled".
    v5.2 had NO field for it, so such outcomes would have been silently dropped and
    the affected papers re-opened later. Added:
      * "Sim patient outcome reported?" — gate (GATE_OPTS), REQUIRED every arm,
        same true-absence-vs-blank logic as the other four gates.
      * "Sim patient outcome description" — free-text narrative, REQUIRED when the
        gate == "Reported". Deliberately NO numeric mean/SD/N block — the protocol
        says this outcome is described, never pooled, so a numeric block would invite
        accidental meta-analysis. SHEET_HEADERS +2.
  - ADHERENCE (PRIMARY) instrument + tier + scale-max. The protocol's primary is a
    hierarchy — steps proportion → checklist total → validated performance score,
    one measure per study — but v5.2 recorded none of WHICH measure/instrument was
    taken. A secondary outcome (NTS) had an instrument field while the primary did
    not. Added, immediately after the Adherence gate:
      * "Adherence measure tier" — which hierarchy level this value is (tier 1/2/3
        / other). REQUIRED when Adherence gate == "Reported". Gives the one-measure-
        per-study audit trail.
      * "Adherence instrument" — free text (e.g., study checklist, OSCAR, TAPAS).
        REQUIRED only for tier 3 (validated scores are named); optional otherwise.
      * "Adherence scale max" — denominator/max of the scale. REQUIRED for tier 2 &
        tier 3 (needed to interpret a raw score across instruments); optional for a
        proportion (implicit 0–100). SHEET_HEADERS +3.
  - UNIT split. The protocol extracts "unit of ANALYSIS"; v5.2's single field was
    labelled "Unit of randomisation" (and the sheet header "Unit (individual/team)").
    For cluster/team designs these differ, and mislabelling them risks a unit-of-
    analysis error in the NMA. Split into TWO required fields:
      * "Unit of randomisation"  (replaces the old ambiguous "Unit (individual/team)")
      * "Unit of analysis"       (new)
    SHEET_HEADERS +1.
  - FIDELITY scale: NO code change. The form keeps its 3-tier (Low/Mid/High/Unclear)
    scale on purpose — it is collapsible to the protocol's 2-tier later without
    re-extraction, whereas 2-tier → 3-tier would force re-reading. Action is on the
    PROTOCOL text (amend its 2-tier wording to 3-tier); do NOT "fix" this form back
    to 2 tiers.
  - Net column count: 81 -> 87. Update the Google Sheet header row BEFORE extraction
    (see the ⚠️ block below for exact insert positions).

v5.2 changes (from v5.1):
  - MERGE KEYS for 4-reviewer dual independent extraction:
      * "Study ID (Covidence)" — the Covidence record number (e.g. 9405), REQUIRED.
        This is the stable per-study key reviewers read straight off Covidence; it
        removes author/year ambiguity (Siebert x4, St Pierre x2, Marshall x2, etc.)
        when two reviewers' rows are reconciled later.
      * "Phase" — Calibration / Main, REQUIRED. Calibration papers are re-extracted
        in Main, so the same reviewer enters a study twice; Phase keeps them apart.
    Both inserted right after "Reviewer" (sheet columns 3 and 4). SHEET_HEADERS 79 -> 81.
    Reconciliation / IRR merge key = Study ID + Phase + Reviewer + Arm No.
  - Reviewer field can be locked to a fixed pick-list: set REVIEWERS = [...4 names...]
    near the top to make it a dropdown (prevents "A"/"a"/"Reviewer A" drift that breaks
    merging). Left empty ([]), Reviewer stays a free-text box (unchanged behaviour).

v5.1 changes (from v5.0):
  - FIDELITY-RATE GATE: "CA use fidelity rate (%)" is now gated by the existing
    "CA use fidelity check" field, NOT by a new 5th gate column.
      * If fidelity check == "Yes — quantitative", a rate is REQUIRED (a blank is
        treated as missing → blocks submission). A quantitative check implies the
        source reported a number, so a blank there is an unrecorded value.
      * For any other check value (ordinal / qualitative / No / Unclear / N-A),
        the rate is left blank and that blank is EXPLAINED by the check field —
        i.e. a true "no quantitative fidelity measure in source", not a forgotten
        entry. This resolves the blank-vs-absent ambiguity WITHOUT adding a column.
    Validation-time only (consistent with the four outcome gates), because widgets
    inside st.form do not re-render on change. SHEET_HEADERS unchanged (still 79).
  - Robustness: "Adherence outcome direction" is now written via _s() so a None
    (when the Adherence gate != "Reported") is stored as "" like every other gated
    field, instead of a raw Python None.

v5.0 changes (from prior build):
  - RoB-2 and MERSQI are now OPTIONAL (assess once per study, normally on Arm 1).
    They are NOT in the blocking required-field checks, so Arm 2/3 submissions
    no longer force re-entry of identical study-level ratings.
  - Error effect-measure field re-labelled to record HOW THE PAPER reported it
    (RR / OR / raw counts / not reported). Raw events + N remain the true
    extraction target; pooled measure (RR) is computed at analysis stage.
  - Median-converter input labels clarified per method (IQR vs range).
  - Total N / Arm N default to blank (None) instead of 0.
  - Adherence-direction note: harmonisation to "higher = better" is performed
    at ANALYSIS stage; here you only record the raw values + their direction.
  - OUTCOME GATES: each of the 4 outcomes (Adherence, Time, Error, NTS) now has
    a required "... reported?" selectbox with options
    [Reported / Not measured / Measured – not extractable / Unclear].
    This distinguishes a TRUE ABSENCE in the source from a blank (not-yet-entered).
    Sub-fields are only enforced when the gate == "Reported".
    Adherence outcome direction is now conditional on the Adherence gate too.

**📌 INSTRUCTIONS**
1. **Reviewer / Study ID / Phase** (Tab 1) — all required. **Study ID = the Covidence record number** for this paper (e.g. 9405); type it exactly as Covidence shows it. **Phase** = *Calibration* (the shared alignment papers) or *Main* (the full extraction).
2. Extract data for **ONE arm per submission**.
3. **Multi-arm study**: after submitting arm 1, just update Arm No., Arm Label, NMA Node, and Outcomes → Submit again. Other fields stay.
4. **New study**: refresh browser (F5 / Cmd+R) to clear all fields.
5. ★ = NMA-critical field (Node, N per arm, Mean/SD/N for primary outcome).
6. For median-reported outcomes, use the **Median → Mean/SD converter** in Tab 4.
7. **RoB-2 & MERSQI are study-level** — assess them ONCE per study (normally on Arm 1). They are optional on later arms of the same study; leave blank to avoid duplicate entry.
8. **Outcome gates** (Tab 4): for EACH of the **five** outcomes pick *Reported / Not measured / Measured–not extractable / Unclear*. Sub-fields are only required when you pick **Reported**. This records a TRUE absence instead of an ambiguous blank.
9. **Fidelity rate** (Tab 3): fill *CA use fidelity rate (%)* ONLY when *CA use fidelity check* = "Yes — quantitative" (then it is required). For any other check value, leave it blank — the check field already records why there is no rate.
10. **Unit** (Tab 1): *Unit of randomisation* = what was allocated to arms; *Unit of analysis* = what the effect size is computed on. They differ for cluster/team designs — fill both.
11. **Adherence tier** (Tab 4): pick which hierarchy level the primary value is (steps proportion > checklist total > validated score). Instrument is required for validated (Tier 3) scores; scale-max is required for Tier 2/3.
12. **Simulated patient outcome** (Tab 4, Outcome 5): descriptive only — narrative text, no numbers, never pooled.
